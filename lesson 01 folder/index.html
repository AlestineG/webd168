       Hi I am Alex. I am in my second year of college at San Diego Meas College. I am taking this course because it is apart of the course that I need to take in order for me to get my degree in Web Development. I have already taken web152, 164, and I am currently taking 154 along with 168.</p>
       <p>I hope to gain more knowledge and comfortability with coding. Not only hand coding, but learning how to use the tools that come with coding, like where to look for resources, AI in some cases, and just a more solid understanding, so that I can hopefully one day work get a job as a web developer.</p>
       <p>My only experience with web design, is the projects that i built in my classes, and side project that I have been working on just to get more practice. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, a little bit of JS. I did try to take a class in Python, that I had trouble understanding that programming language.</p>
       </div>
       <b>My hobbies are</b>
       <!-- added an ordered list so visually it's different from the paragraph section-->
       <ol><i>Netflix, and other streaming services</i></ol>
       <ol><i>playing video games</i></ol>
       <ol><i>making music + djing</i></ol>
